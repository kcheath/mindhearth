# Onboarding Flow Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete implementation of the onboarding flow with passphrase and safety code functionality for the Mindhearth Flutter app.

## 🎯 Implementation Goals Achieved

### ✅ Passphrase Behavior
- **Raw passphrase usage**: The passphrase is used directly for encryption/decryption without key derivation (PBKDF2)
- **Secure storage**: Passphrase is stored using `flutter_secure_storage` and never synced to backend
- **No logging**: Passphrase is never exposed in logs or debug output
- **Encryption service**: Created `EncryptionService` to handle all encryption operations

### ✅ Safety Code Entry
- **5-step onboarding flow**: Welcome → Privacy → Passphrase → Safety Code → Complete
- **User-entered safety codes**: 3 optional codes (Journal, Safe, Wipe) entered by user
- **Optional setup**: Users can choose to set up safety codes or skip them
- **Validation**: Safety codes are validated against stored user codes

### ✅ Debug Mode
- **Full onboarding intact**: Debug mode does not skip any onboarding steps
- **Test user**: Uses `test@tsukiyo.dev` for pre-authentication
- **Enhanced logging**: Detailed logging for onboarding events (excluding sensitive data)
- **Debug helpers**: Debug buttons to fill generated codes and reset flow

### ✅ Reset Functionality
- **Settings integration**: Reset available via Settings > Privacy & Security
- **Complete cleanup**: Clears passphrase, safety codes, and onboarding state
- **Backend safety code clear**: Removes safety codes from backend via DELETE `/users/safety-codes`
- **Navigation fix**: Fixed deactivated widget error in reset flow
- **Proper logout**: Resets authentication state and redirects to login
- **Error handling**: Continues reset even if backend safety code clear fails

## 🔐 Security Features

### Encryption Service
```dart
// Store passphrase securely
await EncryptionService.storePassphrase(passphrase);

// Encrypt content using raw passphrase
String encrypted = EncryptionService.encryptContent(content, passphrase);

// Decrypt content using raw passphrase
String decrypted = EncryptionService.decryptContent(encrypted, passphrase);

// Generate safety codes from passphrase
Map<String, String> codes = EncryptionService.generateSafetyCodes(passphrase);

// Validate safety codes
bool isValid = await EncryptionService.validateSafetyCode(code);
```

### Safety Code Storage
- User-entered codes stored securely using `flutter_secure_storage`
- Three distinct codes: Journal, Safe, and Wipe
- Codes are optional and can be added later in settings
- Validation against stored user codes, not generated from passphrase
- **Session-based verification**: Safety code verification is reset on logout or app exit
- **Conditional verification**: Safety code verification is only required if safety codes were configured

### Secure Storage
- Passphrase stored in `flutter_secure_storage` with key `'user_passphrase'`
- Never transmitted to backend or logged
- Automatically cleared on onboarding reset

## 🎨 User Experience

### Onboarding Flow Steps
1. **Welcome** - Introduction to Mindhearth
2. **Privacy** - Privacy policy and data protection information
3. **Passphrase** - Create and confirm secure passphrase (min 8 chars, no spaces)
4. **Safety Code** - Optionally set up 3 safety codes (Journal, Safe, Wipe) or skip
5. **Complete** - Success confirmation and next steps

### Safety Code Step Features
- **Optional toggle**: Switch to enable/disable safety code setup
- **Three input fields**: Journal, Safe, and Wipe code entry with icons
- **Individual visibility toggles**: Each code can be shown/hidden separately
- **Real-time updates**: Codes are saved to state as user types
- **Security info**: Clear guidance about optional nature of codes

### Debug Features
- **Code display**: Shows generated safety code in debug mode
- **Auto-fill**: Button to populate safety code field
- **Reset flow**: Button to reset entire onboarding process
- **Enhanced logging**: Detailed debug output for troubleshooting

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
- **OnboardingNotifier**: Manages 5-step flow state
- **SafetyCodeNotifier**: Handles safety code verification with session-based reset
- **Riverpod integration**: Clean separation of concerns
- **App lifecycle management**: Safety code verification resets on app pause/exit

### API Integration
- **Backend sync**: Safety codes saved to backend during onboarding
- **Validation**: Both local and remote validation supported
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback if backend unavailable

### Navigation
- **Router integration**: Proper navigation between onboarding steps
- **Context safety**: Fixed deactivated widget issues
- **Reset flow**: Complete state cleanup and logout

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests
- **Encryption service**: 5 comprehensive test cases
- **Safety code generation**: Consistency and uniqueness tests
- **Encryption/decryption**: Round-trip functionality tests
- **Edge cases**: Empty passphrases and special characters

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Encryption/decryption functionality
- ✅ Special character support in passphrases
- ✅ Empty content handling
- ✅ Secure storage methods (not tested in unit tests due to platform dependencies)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Data Protection Integration
The encryption layer is now ready to receive the passphrase for encrypting user content:

```dart
// Example: Encrypting journal entries
String encryptedContent = EncryptionService.encryptContent(
  journalEntry.content, 
  await EncryptionService.getPassphrase()
);

// Example: Decrypting journal entries
String decryptedContent = EncryptionService.decryptContent(
  encryptedContent,
  await EncryptionService.getPassphrase()
);
```

### Future Enhancements
- **Journal encryption**: Apply encryption to journal entries
- **Session encryption**: Encrypt therapy session data
- **Document encryption**: Protect uploaded documents
- **Backup encryption**: Secure backup/restore functionality

## 🔍 Debug Information

### Debug Mode Features
- **Test user**: `test@tsukiyo.dev` (pre-authenticated)
- **Safety code display**: Shows generated codes in debug UI
- **Enhanced logging**: Detailed onboarding event logging
- **Reset functionality**: Easy onboarding reset for testing

### Logging
- ✅ API requests/responses logged
- ✅ Onboarding state changes logged
- ✅ Safety code generation logged
- ❌ Passphrases never logged
- ❌ Safety codes never logged in production
